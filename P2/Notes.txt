4- Order the capture by the column ‘Protocol’; scrolling down, identify the protocols present in the
capture, the actors involved (‘Source’ and ‘Destination’) and the direction of the communication

	Protocols HCI_CMD (host -> controller) and HCI_EVT (controller -> host)

5- Reorder the capture by the column ‘No.”; Looking into the ‘Source’, ‘Destination’ and ‘Protocol’
columns, observe the sequence of the messages exchange
	
	Each HCI_CMD protocol is responded with a HCI_EVT procotol

6- Order the capture using the column ‘Info’ to see the different messages grouped by its specific type. For
instance, check the frequency of the Inquiry process. Look at the ‘Read’, ‘Set’ and ‘Write’ messages used
in the start-up and the overall process.

	Looking at the Sent and Rcvd Inquiry, the Inquiry process happens with around 10 second intervals

7- Order again by the column ‘No.”; Observe and analyse the startup process; see the Read and Write
commands sent to controller and the exchanged information; observe via the timing information and
the time taken by the process

	First the host sends a reset to the controller
	Aftet that the host reads several parameters of the controller and writes its configuration

8- Observe and analyse the periodic Inquiry process. Identify the involved messages of the process.

	Inquiry has 3 messages: 
		(host -> controller) Sent Inquiry
		(controller -> host) Rcvd Command Status (Inquiry)
		(controller -> host) Rcvd Inquiry  Complete

	This process occurs every 10 seconds
